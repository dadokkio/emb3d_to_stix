            "description": "Under a software bootloader authentication scheme, the bootloader is authenticated using a software-based mechanism where the key, authenticated integrity measurement, and verification logic are stored within memory and the authentication is performed on a main/multipurpose processor. This performs boot-time integrity verification of the bootloader to ensure it was not previously modified or tampered with. Before a bootloader is executed, it should be authenticated by taking an integrity measurement (e.g., hash) of the bootloader, and verifying the hash against a stored signed integrity measurement stored in a bootrom. A device may have multiple bootloaders which operate in multiple stages; therefore, this mitigation may need to be implemented and executed multiple times across the stages to ensure the integrity of each stage.Lastly, authenticating the first and all subsequent bootloaders allows the device to build a chain-of-trust, through which a secure boot scheme can be made for the device. Secure boot schemes allow the device to use earlier-staged authenticated bootloaders to authenticate and launch subsequent bootloaders and software.Because this mitigation stores the keys and authentication logic/mechanisms in memory and executes checks on the main CPU, this mitigation is vulnerable to key extractions ( TID-214: Secrets Extracted from Device Root of Trust ) and tampering with the authentication process ( TID-214: Inadequate Bootloader Protection and Verification ). To minimize this threat, the first stage of the bootloader that performs this check should be stored within ROM to prevent modification by possible malicious code injected at runtime.Note : This mitigation is in contrast to a hardware-based bootloader authentication scheme ( MID-002 - Hardware-backed Bootloader Authentication ), where dedicated hardware is used to protect the key and authentication process.Limitation : A software-based bootloader authentication scheme can be bypassed if a threat actor is able to physically extract symmetric keys from storage, memory, or through side-channel analysis of the processor while the key is in-use. Additionally, if the device is using asymmetric encryption, these protections can be undermined by changing the hash of the public key or the public key itself stored on the device.",

A hardware root of trust gives a device the ability to securely store signatures and keys somewhere that they cannot be accessed before or after booting. This root of trust can then be used to perform boot-time integrity verification of the bootloader to ensure it was not previously modified or tampered with. Before a bootloader is executed, it should be authenticated by taking an integrity measurement (e.g., hash) of the bootloader, and verifying the integrity measurement against a signed integrity measurement stored in the hardware element. A device may have multiple bootloaders which operate in multiple stages, this mitigation may need to be implemented and executed across multiple times to ensure integrity of each stage.Additionally, this hardware root of trust can be used to anchor a chain-of-trust flowing from the bootloader that can be used to verify the integrity of other modules on the device.This implementation will vary based on different secure boot schemes and frameworks, along with device architectures and operating systems.Note : This Mitigation requires that the device has a secure hardware root of trust.

            "description": "Building on the simpler MID-009 - Operating System-based Runtime Integrity Check , devices can go further and periodically take integrity measurements and send them out in remote attestation messages. These measurements can be implemented separately across multiple parts of the device stack, such as the bootloader, firmware, software, and application process level, and can include readings on bootloader integrity, device timing statistics, process and page-table integrity, and overall memory integrity. With a combination of all of this information, users can gain a reasonable sense of if the device\u2019s normal operations have been manipulated.Note : Periodic integrity measurements are the most valuable and trustworthy when a device has a secure operating environment in which to perform its measurement calculations and network encryption. The presence of these properties may however expose a device to threats related to PID-41 - Device exposes remote network services , PID-4113 - Device includes cryptographic functions for sensitive data, such as encryption or authentication , PID-251 - Root of Trust is physically accessible or is not immutable , or PID-252 - Root of Trust is immutable",

            "description": "Mechanisms to protect memory against code injection include restricting what parts of memory can execute code and randomizing address space to prevent the development of effective exploits.Executable Space Protection and Write xor Execute (W^X) should be used to restrict what code can be executed in memory. Executable Space Protection uses either hardware or software features to mark memory as non-executable, thereby preventing injected code from being executed. W^X restricts a memory page from being both writable and executable, therefore, any memory that can be overwritten by a threat actor (W), cannot be executable (X).Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is designed to reduce the predictability of memory addresses so that a threat actor cannot consistently find areas of memory that are able to be exploited or manipulated. This can be done across the application and kernel (KASLR) data spaces.Lastly, program stack specific mitigations, such as stack canaries [5], safe/unsafe stack schemes [4], etc. can be used to detect or increase the difficulty of stack overwrite attacks.Devices should use a combination of the above classes of code and memory injection protections to give their device a more secure posture.Limitations : Some mechanisms that specifically address code injection can be bypassed by attacks that reuse existing code, such as return-to-libc and return-oriented programming (ROP). Further, ASLR can be undermined by secondary vulnerabilities that disclose memory space addresses.",

This can greatly reduce attacks targeting memory bounding errors. Memory safety integration in a device can take multiple forms. Individual drivers, libraries, critical kernel functions, or applications should be implemented in memory safe programming languages. In other instances, it may be possible to use entire kernels or OSes written in memory safe programming languages.Consideration : Memory safe programming languages implement memory safety using different mechanisms. Based on a device\u2019s resources and properties, using one language over another may be desirable. For example, certain memory safe programming languages use more resources due to their runtime memory protections. These can include garbage collection, virtual runtime environments, and code interpreters. Languages that fall into this category are Java, Python, and Go. Other languages, such as Rust, use compile-time checks to handle address spacing mappings and frees.Limitation : Use of a memory safe language can help protect against a significant number of common vulnerabilities; however, it does not address every type of software weakness. For example, issues related to input validation, logic flaws, or deserialization can still occur in software written in memory safe languages.",

            "description": "Driver memory isolation separates a given driver from other drivers and OS/Kernel functionality wherever possible. Examples include microkernel architectures and schemes that split some or all of a driver to run in user space vs within a monolithic kernel.Deploying drivers in a memory isolated context is an effective way of reducing the attack surface of an OS/Kernel because drivers are frequently handling I/O operations and external data, making them readily targetable. When drivers are not memory isolated, a vulnerability in one driver may enable a threat actor to move laterally to other drivers or OS/Kernel components, potentially giving them more access on a device. Memory isolation makes lateral movement more difficult.Limitations : Memory can likely never be fully separated due to a need for driver information to be handled by the system or applications running on the device. For this reason, the attack surface will never be entirely eliminated, and other protections, such as the usage of memory safe programming languages, could be put in place to further decrease the threat actor\u2019s attack surface.",

Therefore, 1) structured data and protocols should be designed using the lowest level grammar possible so that 2) parsers can be made using minimally and appropriately matched computational models (e.g., a deterministic push-down automata being used to parse context free input languages instead of a Turing machine).1. Regarding implementing your own protocolThe design of any new protocol should include an understanding of the grammar used to create that protocol and the computational model necessary to parse that protocol to ensure that the language can be correctly represented by a decidable computational model, particularly with regard to the equivalence problem. This would mean building a protocol out of a regular or deterministic context-free grammar.Unless a protocol or input language can be built from a regular or deterministic context-free grammar, any corresponding parsers cannot be built to be recognizers and parsers of that protocol without being made undecidable with regard to the equivalence problem and maintain full protocol functionality. This is important because if a parser built to run over an undecidable grammar with regard to the equivalence problem, it will be impossible to guarantee that the parser does not enter an unwanted or vulnerable state. This makes the parser have a higher chance of exhibiting exploitable behaviors.2. Regarding implementing your own parserThe design of any new protocol parser should be made such that the computational model of that parser conforms to the minimally sufficient computational model necessary to parse that protocol. If a protocol parser is made to be more complex than the grammar used to make the protocol would otherwise require, threat actors may be able to discover unwanted or vulnerable states that could lead to exploitation. Minimally necessary computational models, ideally ones that are decidable with regard to the equivalence problem, allow for machine states to be checked and give threat actors less opportunities to exploit parser behavior.",

The operating system should verify the authenticity of those peripheral firmware packages as part of, or alongside, the checking the driver prior to loading them on the peripheral hardware (e.g., an FPGA, sub-component microcontroller, etc.)This authentication scheme should be coupled with MID-001- Software Only Bootloader Authentication or MID-002 - Hardware-backed Bootloader Authentication , where the device authenticates the bootloader and then leverages that trusted bootloader to verify all the drivers that are going to be run on the device.

            "description": "The OS should enforce access controls for all users and programs to prevent unauthorized access to OS resources, services, and system calls. There are numerous methods of restricting permissions and privileges to users and programs, including leveraging OS-based access control mechanisms that restrict OS system calls or sandbox-based approaches that encapsulate programs within restrictive environments. These mechanisms should be implemented to enforce access based on the principle of least privilege - which states that programs and users should only have access to the resources that they absolutely need to operate, and nothing else.Operating systems typically deploy various access control mechanisms that restrict which system calls can be executed and what resources those system calls can access. While many operating systems include a default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) mechanism, these have limitations on their ability to define granular permissions for privileged functions. Strong access control mechanisms include (i) capabilities-based permission models, which provide more granular controls over privileged functions, or (ii) mandatory access control (MAC) mechanisms (e.g., SELinux), which allow fully customizable privileges across all system calls and resources. Further, programs should obtain privileged access only for key functions and then downgrade those privileges after the function is performed (e.g., setuid/setguid). The access control mechanisms deployed by the device must be sufficiently sophisticated to support the variety of programs and applications, their exposure to threats (e.g., networks services), and the criticality of specific data or resources.Other mechanisms can be used to further restrict what resources an executing process may access. For example, in Linux the seccomp feature can be used to limit which of the OS kernel\u2019s system calls a process may invoke, further constricting the attack surface a compromised process can access to increase its foothold on a device.",

            "description": "Sandboxes are software execution environments that run code under restrictions to limit that code\u2019s access to system resources a non-restricted user-level process would otherwise have access to. This is especially useful when handling untrusted code provided by users (e.g., a PLC program) or 3 rd parties (e.g., JavaScript from a remote web site), especially when supporting such code is a mandatory device function and cannot simply be forbidden (as in MID-051).A sandbox runtime provides only filtered and managed access to system resources. For example, an untrusted program will not have direct access to invoke kernel syscalls, read or write to files, access network interfaces, etc. The runtime can then provide only limited access to specific constrained resources governed by security policy, which can significantly reduce the risk of executing untrusted code. These protections will make lateral movement to different processes more difficult for malicious code running within a sandbox, as the code has no access to memory in those processes and has very little, to no, access to privileged function calls. Malicious code will be unable to access and manipulate data, memory, and code outside the sandbox without first finding and exploiting a vulnerability in the sandbox itself. Mobile devices running iOS and Android are a widely used example of this, running all applications in individual sandboxes to protect user data from malicious applications [1][4]. Another example is the WebAssembly format, adopted recently in web browsers, which allows compiled code to safely execute in a sandbox created by the browser (similar to how JavaScript code is sandboxed) [5].Additionally, the abstraction provided by a sandbox can be used to prevent untrusted code from exploiting vulnerabilities that require low-level access to hardware (e.g., TID-103, TID-110). For example, in response to the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities, web browsers deployed changes to their JavaScript engines to reduce the resolution of timers available to JavaScript code, reducing timer accuracy below the threshold necessary to successfully exploit the timing-based side channel [2][3]. A similar change in Chromium-based browsers eliminates a form of RowHammer that researchers crafted using JavaScript and WebGL [2].",

            "description": "Some operating systems offer the ability to create containers that wrap small sets of applications in isolated partitions. Each container has its own view of system resources that is isolated from other containers and the host OS. Examples include Linux containers (LXC), Docker, BSD jails, etc. Container partitions are created by the host OS kernel which provides each container with isolated copies of various system resources, such as a unique guest filesystem, partitioned network stack, process ID space, user ID space, etc. Unlike virtualization (see MID-022), container systems do not need to provide virtualized views of hardware running separate full operating systems, instead abstracting at the level of a single kernel instance allows for lower performance overhead. However, OS kernels typically have a larger attack surface than a VM system\u2019s hypervisor, so containers are generally considered to be a weaker form of isolation than virtualization [2]. Device designers should consider risk vs performance tradeoffs when selecting which isolation technology to implement, although both technologies can used in parallel to achieve the desired balance.Containers offer several opportunities for security hardening. All the capabilities of MID-012 and MID-013 are available within each container partition. Furthermore, container filesystems can be stripped down to the bare minimum necessary for the applications within the container to function (see MID-016 \u2013 Least Functionality ). So-called \u201crootless\u201d container design patterns can be employed such that all processes within a container context run with unprivileged non-root user permissions. Host-side orchestration tools like Docker, can enforce additional security restrictions over container contexts when they are created [1]. For example, seccomp syscall filters can be applied to each container to restrict what kernel interfaces any process within that container may access, which reduces the opportunities for container breakout attacks [4]. Finally, device developers may consider utilizing non-persistent or immutable (read-only) container image design patterns. These increase the difficulty for attackers to establish a foothold within a container while simplifying the process of restoring containers to a known-good state through restarting containers from an integrity-checked known-good state periodically or in response to indicators of compromise.Note : Containers can offer additional non-security benefits to device developers. The additional modularization they provide can make application development and maintenance more efficient, including making various devops practices more accessible to embedded device development workflows [6].",

This allows device operators and security teams to investigate device actions and hunt for unusual behavior that may be indicators of compromise.Programmable devices like PLCS should keep logs of all program changes so that device operators have the ability to audit them to check for threat actor attempts to manipulate device operating environments. Particularly useful auditable events include program edits, appends, and online edits.Limitations : Embedded devices often have constraints that limit the extent of on-device logging, such as a lack of storage space, NVRAM burnout, and network bandwidth limitations. Device designers and operators should take these limitations into account when choosing what data should be logged either locally or remotely.Consideration : Devices should take TID-224: Excessive Access via Software Diagnostic Features into consideration when designing their logging and log access scheme. Logging sensitive information, such as system crash information (core dumps, memory addresses), credentials, or keys, or giving read access to non-privileged users, could expose the device to information leaks.Note : It is possible to overcome some of the storage limitations by offloading the data over the network. While this presents other issues related to network bandwidth, data reliability, and network-data costs, it helps to overcome some other device-level limitations.Note : See the threats associated with PID-324 - Device includes support for \u201cprogram uploads\u201d to retrieve programs from the device from an engineering workstation for more information about uploading programs for inspection.",

            "description": "Virtual machines increase the level of isolation for software and data by virtualizing and partitioning device hardware and running their own dedicated operating system kernel (unlike containers that share a kernel). This provides stronger separation than kernel-based containers (MID-015) or process separation (MID-013) but at the cost of higher performance overhead. Software compromises will be contained within a VM even if the threat actor can successfully exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability in the OS kernel within a given VM, protecting any code or data present in other VMs.Hardware-assisted Virtual Machines (VMs) take advantage of CPU extensions that specifically support virtualization use cases to enforce strict separation between VMs\u2019 RAM and other resources. A hypervisor can utilize these CPU features to provide a high degree of assurance in that separation with relatively little performance overhead compared to a fully software-based VM scheme. More advanced hardware features extend the hardware-based separation to I/O device access by extending the functionality of IOMMU features (see MID-053).Note : Implementing this mitigation will likely expose devices to threats associated with PID-242 - Device includes hypervisor .",

The hypervisor brokers the access guest VMs have to virtual and physical hardware resources and any support services implemented by the hypervisor itself. Because of its privilege level, the hypervisor must be hardened against comprise, a multi-faceted process that can involve multiple technical controls to increase hypervisor security.Hypervisor-side software components that help implement hypervisor service APIs and the virtual hardware devices exposed to guest VMs should be isolated and sandboxed with minimal privileges to constrain any compromise of those components from spreading to more privileged domains within the hypervisor context. For example, in a hypervisor/host-OS combination based on Linux\u2019s KVM features, the software processes implementing each VM could be run with reduced privileges and under a restrictive SELinux policy [4].In an embedded systems context, the configuration of the hypervisor and guest VMs is likely to be relatively static with no need to dynamically stop, start, or alter the configurations of VMs during runtime. In that case the hypervisor software and its configurations could be stored in immutable memory to the extent possible and only allowed to be changed as a result of the device\u2019s secure update mechanism.Hypervisor software and data should also be integrated into the secure boot process to ensure its integrity before the device starts, as can be seen in MID-002 - Hardware-backed Bootloader Authentication . This can be done by placing bootloader-time integrity checks over the hypervisor to ensure that hypervisor code is safe to run according to factory or user-defined signatures.",

By virtue of virtual machines (VMs) being run on the same hardware, potential exploits and data leaks are present through hardware or device architecture vulnerabilities.Encrypting VMs and VM-related information can help maintain VM isolation in the presence of an untrustworthy hypervisor by keeping each VMs data confidential during execution. The added encryption makes it such that the VM\u2019s memory space is protected against unauthorized reads by the hypervisor or any other VM. Only undecipherable could be seen from any context other than the intended guest VM that memory belongs to.Cloud computing uses cases are driving the adoption of these confidential computing features in newer processors. They build upon the RAM encryption functionality (described further in MID-065) that creates encrypted enclaves in memory associated with a particular execution context (thread, process, etc.) such that the contents of that memory are encrypted automatically by the CPU before being written to RAM and automatically decrypted when read in and placed in the CPU\u2019s cache and registers.",

            "description": "Firmware update mechanisms can provide a vector for threat actors to install malicious code, extract secrets from the firmware, or disrupt the device\u2019s availability. A secure firmware update mechanism must ensure the authenticity of the firmware, encrypt the file or communication channel, ensure updates cannot be triggered at inopportune times, and prevent rollback to insecure versions. Key functions of a secure firmware update are provided below.1- Authenticity and Integrity : The device should validate that the firmware update has not been tampered with before installing it on the device. The vendor should digitally sign the firmware using a protected private key, while the device should include an associated public key or public key hash to verify the signature scheme [1]. The digital signature should be computed across the entire firmware file. To sign a firmware image, the firmware signer should compute a hash of the firmware and run that hash through a signing software. The device can then take a hash of the firmware that it receives and use the public key to verify the signature from the signed hash to compare the two hash values [7].2- Encryption : Encrypting firmware in-transit and at-rest is an effective way to prevent adversaries from reverse engineering the firmware to extract secrets or discovering vulnerabilities.At-rest : If the firmware deployment requires firmware to be manually downloaded and transferred, stored on intermediary devices before reaching the target device, or stored anywhere on the device before loading into flash memory, then the firmware file should be encrypted. Encryption on-device could be implemented by encrypting all sections of the firmware and having the bootloader decrypt the firmware when it needs to be loaded. The bootloader would check the authenticity and integrity of the encrypted firmware, as mentioned in step 1, and then would decrypt the firmware if all the checks pass. The firmware would then be available for execution [8][9].In-transit : If the firmware is deployed using an over-the-air update scheme (i.e., the firmware file will not reside on any intermediary systems), encryption should be provided by using an encrypted and authenticated communication protocol with public key-based authentication [9].3- Update Initiation : If a device can have its firmware update process initiated at any time, threat actors may be able to cause a denial-of-service attack against the device by initiating it at an unwanted time. To prevent these scenarios, all manually initiated firmware updates should only be initiated by authenticated and authorized privileged administrative users. In the event that the device is using automatic firmware updates, any requests to initiate the firmware update should go over an encrypted and authenticated protocol.4- Rollback Protection : Optionally, rollback protections can be added to the firmware update process to prevent threat actors from reinstalling an older, vulnerable version of firmware for future exploitation. Adding rollback protections are not always needed and may complicate device processes. See MID-030 - Firmware Rollback Protections for more information.Additional Threats: This mitigation depends on multiple cryptographic mechanisms, protocols, and keys, which are all potentially vulnerable to different threats (listed below), which should also be considered with the implemented solution.TID-330 Cryptographic Timing Side-Channel TID-214 Secrets Extracted from Device Root of Trust TID-411 Weak/Insecure Cryptographic Protocol TID-318 Insecure Cryptographic Implementation TID-317 Predictable Cryptographic Key",

These are libraries that have been examined, tested, and vetted for safety, security, and protection against side-channels by independent laboratories according to industry approved specifications. Building cryptographic libraries is a complex and difficult process that oftentimes results in libraries that have issues either with the generation or processing of cryptographic primitives or the processing of implemented algorithms over the input data.Additionally, if any of the above issues do arise, using libraries that aren\u2019t validated and aren\u2019t maintained could lead to vulnerabilities persisting while fixes are developed. Therefore, using widely used, well maintained, and validated cryptographic libraries is a safer way to manage device cryptography. Vulnerabilities will be less likely to arise and, if/when they do, the wide level of use and maintenance will mean that patches should come quickly for it.Limitations : By using a widely used library, a device\u2019s cryptographic library is more likely to be targeted, which could lead to the device being vulnerable to exploitation.Consideration : Devices that use cryptographic algorithms may introduce threats via the choice or implementation of the cryptographic algorithm or software. Device builders should take precautionary steps wherever possible to mitigate this threat.

For example, 1 st stage bootloader code stored in a hardware RoTs can be used to check firmware or later-stage bootloader authenticity and integrity before installing and running. This then allows the device to have a degree of certainty that the low-level code it is running is secure.Usually, a hardware RoT consists of cryptographic keys and minimal boot code that uses the keys to ensure that the next piece of code is trusted to run. In the case of an immutable RoT, the cryptographic keys are immutable, for example written in OTP (One-Time Programmable) memory, and the boot code is immutable (BootROM).Consideration : Making a RoT immutable can provide greater assurance by preventing the RoT from being tampered with by threat actors. If the RoT can never be changed, then threat actors cannot manipulate it to perform malicious actions. However, if a RoT is immutable and a vulnerability is found in the code stored within it, there are no ways to patch the device (see TID-220). Code on RoTs should therefore have minimal complexity and should be developed and deployed with the highest possible code quality standards.",

            "description": "To deploy firmware rollback protections, devices need to take steps to ensure that once new firmware has been deployed and is confirmed to be operational on the device, older firmware cannot be deployed again. There are many ways to handle increasing firmware version numbers, with two implementations being an automatic update on reset and an update on command.\u201cAutomatic update on reset\u201d [1] involves the Boot ROM updating the anti-rollback reference version when a newer version has been successfully loaded. To reach a success stage, the new image must pass all secure boot checks, such as the authenticity and integrity checks in MID-026 - Secure Firmware Update. This method gives no window of attack for threat actors trying to rollback firmware between updates and firmware success, however it also means that if there are errors in the firmware the user cannot revert to the last-known-good copy. Vendors themselves however can still rollback to a previous version by repackaging the firmware and distributing it with new version numbers [1].\u201cUpdate on command\u201d [1] involves the anti-rollback reference version being updated in response to a secure message from an authorized management service. The previous version is therefore revoked only after the device management service signals that the newer version has no identified faults. This means that the device will be able to revert to an earlier version of the firmware before they receive the final message. While this gives users increased flexibility because they can choose to accept or reject firmware after trying it out, it also means that devices are left vulnerable during the window between firmware update and when the secure message is received. Additionally, this method may leave devices vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack that can be initiated by blocking the secure completion message. The device will therefore never accept the firmware and won\u2019t begin operations [1].Consideration : If an attacker can spoof the anti-rollback references to increment the versions, the device could be rendered inoperable. Vendors must ensure that only authorized software is able to update the anti-rollback references. See MID-026 - Secure Firmware Update for more information. Given the risks and challenges in creating a resilient rollback protection feature, device designers should carefully consider whether this mitigation is appropriate for their use case before pursuing it.",

This can prevent threat actors from undertaking malicious actions because the device will reject any changes or actions while in an operating mode that does not accept changes.Limitations : Devices that require physical presence may be difficult to manage in remote locations, can increase response or update rollout timelines, and provide limited benefits in locations that have poor physical security.

These schemes allow the device receiving the network traffic to perform cryptographic checks of the data to ensure that it originated from a trusted source and has not been modified in-transit. Only then will it parse the message and process data within.Note : Authentication should be paired with MID-035 - Encrypt Network Traffic to prevent eavesdropping.Limitations : Malicious actors may be able to circumvent authentication protections through various means.

            "description": "A nonce is a piece of data, typically a number, that is created uniquely per message to ensure that messages cannot be replayed. When a device receives a message, it checks the nonce to make sure that the nonce is still valid, and if it is, it will accept the message. If the nonce is no longer valid, the device will know that the same message was sent to them multiple times, potentially indicating a replay attack, and will reject the message.The first nonce in a communication is oftentimes sent in the first message by the device that is initiating the communication. The nonce will then undergo some operation that both the sender and receiver know. Subsequently, in every message the device will receive a transmission with a nonce, perform the operation, and send the new nonce in the next message. This results in a situation where every message has a unique nonce and the sender and receiver can know what the next nonce will be in advance, but the adversary cannot derive it as they do not know the operation or initial nonce.Nonces can sometimes be implemented alongside MID-037 - Network Timestamps to give devices time windows and unique message identifiers to work with. If the device is not using a timestamp, it will have to ensure that the nonce is it using is sufficiently large or random so that it cannot be guessed. If it can be guessed, it may be possible for threat actors to send malicious messages with valid nonces. For example, if a device uses a counter as the initial nonce and adding one as its operation, it may be possible for a threat actor to guess the next number in sequence.

Because these actions could have a large impact on device operations, users should have to authenticate to perform administrative actions and should only be allowed to take actions that they are permitted to after authentication.Limitations : If the threat actor can gain access to valid credentials, they will be able to subvert these protections.

This control could involve read/write permissions of raw memory, process control, process monitoring, and power information, for example. To prevent a threat actor from having this level of access, device designers could either remove the functionality or, if it is needed, heavily restrict its usage.If a device doesn\u2019t need diagnostic functionality, it is more secure for that device to not have any present. Diagnostic functions provide a large threat vector for threat actors because of their inherently privileged nature. By removing the functionality, threat actors have no already-installed tool on the device that gives them such low level access.If a device must have diagnostic functionality, those functions should be heavily restricted. One way this can be done is by restricting the diagnostic functions to certain processes. This could limit the potential impact of a threat actor because they would be scoped to a narrow part of the device. Another way to implement this is by using a processor that has features to prevent unintended tampering (open states, restricted state, and closed state). This would provide a hardware-enforced means to limit the ability of a remote threat actor from accessing the diagnostic functions.Limitations : If threat actors are able to take control over the protection mechanisms that grant or revoke diagnostic functionality access, they may be able to escalate their privileges and take control over a device.",

            "description": "For programmable devices like PLCs, signing programs gives the device the ability to ensure that the programs that they are installing and running originate from a verified source. If the programs are not signed, it may be possible for a threat actor to install malicious programs that alter device behavior.Devices can enable these capabilities by allowing the device to accept, store, and use verifying keys to verify that a program is signed. If the program is not signed, the device should automatically reject the new program and send out an alert.Users should be able to generate signing and verifying keys (public and private asymmetric keys) and send the verifying key to downstream devices that will be receiving programs. Programs can then be signed, either by Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) or another signing mechanism and distributed to the device for verification and deployment.Note : This mitigation is heavily dependent on the security of the source of the programs/application. Many devices, such as PLCs, require the deployment of custom programs that are developed individually at each organization.Limitation : This would require a dedicated signing key to be deployed within the IDE and a verifying key within the end device. Ideally this would be a unique signing key for every organization, however, this would require each organization to perform the key initialization and exchange with each new IDE or device. This scheme gets more complex as typically there are many IDEs within an organization that may need to deploy programs to a device, further organizations need to perform key escrow to store keys, otherwise if the IDEs and associated keys are lost, they will be unable to deploy programs to the device. If organizational keys are not used, and the same signing key is used across an entire product line, a threat actor may be able to extract this key from the IDE (such as through reverse engineering) and then use it to sign an unauthorized program.",

It is this latter copy that is returned to the programmer when using \u201cupload from device\u201d functions in the IDE. The binary and textual representations should be cryptographically bound so that the IDE can test whether the textual representation matches the executable representation.One way to ensure consistency would be to perform upload both the running binaries and text code during a program upload.

Network communications, user authentication handshakes, data protection, and other protocols are implemented using cryptographic algorithms and operations to protect information and achieve other desired security guarantees. Devices should implement protocols that are widely used, well tested, verified for security assurances, and utilize strong cryptographic algorithms. Examples of these are WPA3 and TLS.Note : Chosen protocols should incorporate anti-metadata analysis features such as packet length standardization, packet frequency standardization, header length standardization, etc. Overall, packet metadata shouldn\u2019t be able to be used to derive the contents of encrypted messages. This is only needed where confidentiality exists and is important to device security [3] [4] [5].Note : Many leading cryptographic algorithms are publicly available for use and inspection, meaning that device implementors can verify for themselves that the algorithms are safe to use and compatible with their devices.Note : Choosing a high-quality implementation of the desired cryptographic tools is very important to ensure that they will operate as intended and that cryptographic security guarantees cannot be undermined by implementation flaws. See MID-027 - Validated Cryptographic Library for more information. In addition to library choice, other related architecture considerations must be made. These can include secure key storage ( MID-028 - Hardware-backed Key Storage ) and secure key generation ( MID-047 - Sufficient Entropy for Keys ), to name a few.Note : Encryption may introduce operational difficulties and constraints.

For example, a device may institute a 1-minute lockout after 5 wrong guesses, 3-minute lockout after 10 wrong guesses, 30-minute lockout after 20 wrong guesses, and so on. The threat actor therefore has to wait 34 minutes just to guess 20 passwords, while legitimate users that mistype their password once or twice are minimally impacted.Depending on the environment, lockouts can also be used. A lockout would instead lock the device so that no more authentication attempts can be made after a certain amount of password attempts were performed. Lockouts present risks to the device because devices will be unusable until the lockout is lifted, meaning that a denial-of-service-type effect is possible. This lockout can be lifted either through some authenticated administrative process and/or by requiring physical presence on the device (see MID-031 - Physical Presence Validation for more information).",

            "description": "To create sufficiently random keys, devices need a source of data with a high degree of entropy to ensure that the keys are not predictable. If a device does not have a source of sufficient entropy and tries to create a key, it may be possible that the inputs that seeded the key or pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) can be guessed and therefore threat actors may be able to recreate the key or predict the PRNG output. By using a high degree of entropy, keys and seeds are fully random and cannot be recreated by threat actors, thereby making them cryptographically stronger.Devices typically feed their entropy pools by collecting the unpredictable least significant bits from device events like the absolute and relative timing between things like hardware interrupts, user input, and other similarly unpredictable events. Complex devices like desktop and server PCs can rely on plentiful sources of such events. Embedded devices often do not have as rich a set of hardware, may have no direct interactive user input, fewer processes and applications executing, and are generally more regular and constrained in their actions. This can result in embedded systems having a shallower pool of entropy to draw upon when the need to generate cryptographic keys arises.Operations that consume data from an entropy pool to generate keys of seed PRNGs must wait until a sufficient quantity is available. To avoid (potentially long) pauses in operation, especially at boot up, some devices have been known to use non-blocking sources, and as a result the keys they generated were predictable and vulnerable to attack. To remain secure, devices should use a blocking entropy pool that waits until there is sufficient entropy to fulfill the request for random numbers. If the device doesn\u2019t have a way to generate enough entropy on first boot, devices may require mechanisms to obtain additional sufficient entropy (e.g. ask for random user inputs). If that is not practical, the design may need to be modified to include a cryptographic quality hardware-based random number generator (see MID-048 - Hardware Random Number Generator and MID-060 - Dedicated Hardware Cryptographic Modules ).Note : Using sufficiently random keys is an important part of maintaining the security guarantees that a good cryptographic algorithm will provide. See MID-044 - Strong Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols for more information about cryptographic algorithms.",

Therefore, hardware random number generators can be used to create keys that have a high degree of entropy for their seeds and themselves have a high degree of randomness.Note : Implementors should be sure to verify that the hardware RNG they are considering produces a random stream of sufficient cryptographic quality for use in key generation and not simply a hardware implementation of a lower quality pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithm.",

Hashing algorithms are one-way algorithms that can turn data into a unique fixed-length string representation of that data. Since this algorithm is one-way, data that is hashed cannot be turned back into its cleartext form, meaning that threat actors who come across hashed passwords have to try to hash every password combination until they have a match.Threat actors have been known to use pre-calculated lookup tables of hashed potential password values to accelerate the password guessing process. Salting can prevent this from happening by increasing the required size of the lookup tables to make this approach to guessing impractical. Salts are pieces of random data that are appended to the password before hashing and then are stored with the hashed password. What this does is make the password hash unique because the password is actually the password + the hashed data. Therefore, this password cannot be found in a hash lookup table, but the salted hash can still be calculated by the device within an acceptably short time bound.",

This removes opportunities for threat actors to access or modify unencrypted firmware code, configurations, or other sensitive data.Limitations : Extensive use of encryption can impact performance as data must be decrypted every time it is loaded for use. This may limit what portions of data are practical to encrypt or require migrating a design to use processors with hardware acceleration for decryption. Additionally, private and secret keys must be sufficiently protected, ideally in a hardware-backed keystore (see MID-028), or at least in on-chip memory (see MID-064) and should not be shared between devices (see MID-033).",

Example techniques include designing computations to be independent of sensitive values from a time or power perspective, balancing the operations on either side of conditional statements, using unpredictable ordering for bit or byte test and comparison operations, adding randomness or noise, and limiting secret key reuse.",

Dedicated cryptographic modules can implement hardware-based defenses that are not possible in a software library. In processor-constrained designs, hardware acceleration of cryptographic algorithms can enable implementing stronger algorithms and key sizes than may be practical in a software-only solution. As with software cryptographic libraries, implementors should prefer modules that have been examined, tested, and vetted by independent laboratories according to industry approved specifications.Note : This has several important distinctions from MID-028 - Hardware-backed Key Storage. In the MID-028 case, key material may reside in hardware-backed or hardware-based storage, but the hardware lacks the means to perform cryptographic operations using that key without exposing it to the system\u2019s processor.

For example, functions that process untrusted data or otherwise make up the device\u2019s attack surface should be separated from security and functionality critical operations. Avoid separating security decisions (e.g., authorization checks, signature validations) from the data and operations they govern; doing so can introduce weaknesses that allow bypassing those checks.Limitations : Adding additional processors to separate device functions and data necessarily increases the complexity and cost of the device\u2019s hardware and software.

Tunable Replica Circuits (TRCs) [1] can be used to detect voltage and clock timing changes and have been deployed within some newer commercial CPUs from Intel [2]. Brown-out detection and reset circuits, as found in some microcontrollers, have been proposed to interrupt voltage glitch attacks if sensitive enough [8], however research has shown these can be bypassed by tuning the attack carefully [9][10] although it does increase the difficulty of the attack [10]. Comparison techniques can be used to detect attacks on processor clock signals [3][4]. Finely targeted electromagnetic interference (EMI) attacks can bypass single chip-wide voltage and clock-based defenses but have been shown to be detectable embedding multiple detectors within a chip [3] and by phase locked loop (PLL)-based sensor circuits [5]. [6] examines several detection schemes for optical fault injection techniques, such as embedding photosensors and shielding in a chip.A combination of multiple hardware and software-based mitigation techniques (see MID-063) to address the range of fault injection types, as recommended by [8], can prove more effective than any individual mitigation.",

            "description": "Many software-based mitigations to fault injection have been imposed. These range from coding patterns and strategies that can be used at development time, to automated compiler-based techniques, and hybrid approaches that take advantage of hardware features.Certain programming patterns can harden pieces of code against common faults [1][2][3]. Redundancy is one such pattern, i.e., performing certain comparisons, memory reads, or function calls multiple times and comparing the results. Others include: choosing constant flag values with a large Hamming distance between them that are hard for a fault to generate or flip between, (e.g., multi-byte random bit strings instead of 0 and 1); adding code checks for \u2018impossible\u2019 paths through logic trees that could only be reached as a result of a fault; adding random time delays to operations; checking that loops executed to completion without stopping early; etc.Other research has proposed more systematic approaches to hardening code at compile time. As compile-time approaches must be automated and generally applicable to all code, they often implement more narrow protections against specific types of faults. Examples include automating the insertion of duplicate computations and comparisons throughout an application [4] or hardening the control flow of loops [5]. Instruction duplication (ID) is one commonly proposed technique that can be automatically applied [6][7], however it has been shown over time that ID is only effective against faults that skip single instructions [8][9]. An attacker that can coordinate multiple faults to target each duplication can likely still achieve their objective. [13] demonstrates that such coordination is feasible with readily accessible tools.Other general-purpose protections that protect a program\u2019s control flow graph, e.g., control flow integrity (CFI), can provide some protection against faults that alter function pointers and jump addresses similar to how a software exploit would. Software-based CFI schemes [10][11] and hardware-assisted schemes (e.g., using ARM pointer authentication) [12] have been explored. See MID-007 and MID-020 for more information on CFI and pointer authentication/encryption.A combination of multiple hardware and software-based mitigation techniques (see MID-062) to address the range of fault injection types, as recommended by [3], can prove more effective than any individual mitigation.",

Common implementation patterns include storing keys and bootloader code used to bootstrap loading further stages of encrypted firmware (see MID-054) from external storage and to verify its authenticity as part of a secure boot chain. In other applications, the device firmware may be small enough to fit entirely within such on-chip storage (see MID-055).Note : MID-058 must be implemented as well to obtain the protection afforded by this mitigation.Limitations : Motivated attackers may resort to invasive and destructive analysis of ICs which can extact data or reset security fuses.

            "description": "As DRAM densities increase and cell sizes shrink, they become increasingly vulnerable to RowHammer-style attacks. Since its discovery, many solutions have been proposed in the research community to varying degrees of success [1]. ECC memory can provide some protection against single bit errors, but multi-bit flip RowHammer variants have been demonstrated that exceed ECC\u2019s ability to correct [2]. ECC-detectable single bit errors may occur during an attempted RowHammer and provide indication to a firmware or operating system-level mitigation that an attack is underway.Newer DRAM specifications have introduced defenses, such as DDR4\u2019s Target Row Refresh (TRR) mechanism, that have made a successful RowHammer attack more difficult. However, attack methods have been refined to achieve success even on TRR-enabled DRAMs [3]. Not all DRAM modules are equally susceptible, and the memory controllers built into processors have implemented defenses of various efficacy. In [3], the authors show how to test the performance of a particular combination.JEDEC updated the DDR5 specification in 2024 (JESD79-5C) to add Per-Row Activation Counting (PRAC) [4]. PRAC-enabled DRAM chips track individual DRAM row activations and signal the memory controller when the count exceeds a threshold value indicating a potential victim row requires a refresh that the controller must then command. Recent research concludes that PRAC does mitigate a RowHammer-style attack in many cases, although is subject to potentially high performance and energy overheads [5].If the CPU/SoC\u2019s memory controller supports it, system firmware and device operating system could cooperate with the memory controller hardware to leverage indicators from ECC, PRAC, etc. to inform additional layers of mitigation, such as identifying and terminating the offending application process conducting the RowHammer attack [6].",

A message authentication code (MAC) scheme can be sufficient to protect the integrity of bus data from manipulation, but a more complete encryption scheme is required to maintain confidentiality. More complex chips (e.g., microcontrollers) will often be needed on either end of the communication that have specialized support for pairing, key management, message authentication codes, and encryption. Additionally, the extra overhead of adding encryption often requires migrating to newer, more capable bus protocols that support encryption, for examples CAN-FD vs. CAN [1]. On the higher end of performance, the PCI SIG is developing the Integrity and Data Encryption feature for inclusion in a future version of the PCIe bus specification [2].Apple\u2019s TouchID fingerprint authentication mechanism incorporates an example of this mitigation [3]. The device\u2019s TouchID fingerprint sensor and the Secure Enclave chip are provisioned with a unique shared key at manufacturing time. This key is used to negotiate an additional session key that encrypts and authenticates the sensor data as it passes between the two chips.Limitations : Many common PCB-level bus and interconnect protocols do not support encryption or authentication. Restricting a device design to components that do have these features may be a too limiting or too costly constraint. Device pairing and key management mechanisms and processes are necessary, add complexity to device design and manufacturing, especially to implement unique keys on each device (see MID-033).",

            "description": "To protect against malicious or compromised peripherals, a system might institute a scheme in which peripherals are considered untrusted until authenticated and authorized to access necessary system resources (e.g., system memory for DMA). Internal system components are often implicitly trusted, although many contain firmware of their own that, if modified, may cause the device to behave maliciously. Trusting external peripherals (e.g., USB devices) is always a risk. Each of a device\u2019s processors and other components may instead treat other bus-connected components similarly to remote nodes on a network, perform cryptographic mutual authentication of a components\u2019 identities, and use this to execute trust decisions. Measurement and attestation of component firmware can add further assurance.Some Apple devices implement a form of this for certain security-sensitive components like the TouchID fingerprint reader [2].Upcoming revisions of the PCI Express specification will add the Component Measurement and Authentication (CMA) mechanism [1], which will allow a system to verify the authenticity of a PCIe device and its firmware before allowing it to access system resources, preventing malicious or compromised peripherals from obtaining the degree of system access needed to perform attacks.",

Encoding outputs ensures that all outputted variables on the web application are converted into text before displaying.

For example, putting quotes around variables, using escape sequences, using encoding formats for special characters like single or double quotes, and putting displayed variables in safe HTML or CSS structures can all help to prevent code execution upon output. These controls should be used when the user has the ability to edit any HTML on the webpage.Potential ways to sanitize HTML input include using the JavaScript DOMPurify.sanitize() function and storing variables in safe structures or \u201csafe sinks\u201d.

            "description": "Web apps should not pass SQL queries for execution by a database unless they conform to one of the recommended query formation mitigations below. Methods can include 1) only executing prepared statements with parameterized queries, 2) only executing stored procedures, and 3) allow-list input validation [1].Prepared statements with parameterized queries change the way that the web app will process a user request and form a query. When using prepared statements, the web app that processes the user data will take the user data and place it into a pre-defined section of the query, with the rest of the query already formed. Therefore, the actual SQL commands that the database will be executing are handled and compiled before the user input is processed and inserted, so the user input cannot introduce any new potentially malicious commands. This is then coupled with parameterized variables, where variables are set to be a certain type before being inserted into the SQL statement to ensure that no variable can be misconstrued as a command and not a string, for example.Stored procedures are procedures that are crafted and pre-stored on the web app. They can be sent to the SQL database upon prompting from the client to the web app. Since these statements are pre-crafted and stored before the client has any interaction with the web app, the client cannot send custom queries that may be malicious. Assuming that the user data is parameterized here as well, users will not be able to inject data into the query that will not be interpreted as a literal data type. Therefore, the threat surface is lowered because the stored procedures can be implemented safely, and user input will not be able to add any new commands.Allow-list input validation is implemented by creating an allow-list of parameters for clients to choose from. This allow list can be implemented through conditionals like if \u2026 else and switch statements. This would prevent potential commands contained in user inputs from being a part of the final SQL query statement given to the database.Limitation : If a device is using stored procedures, particular care needs to be made to what permissions the stored procedure executor has. If the device has device-level users, the user that executes the procedures may need a high-level of permissions, which could make that user a target to threat actors.",

This can prevent threat actors from inserting alternative paths (e.g., using relative directory names or symlinks) that map to the target file but that the device was not expecting, which may result in bypassing file access control policies.

            "description": "A device can be susceptible to denial-of-service when its ability to process network messages and requests is overwhelmed by a threat actor, causing device resources (e.g., processing, memory, bandwidth, ports, etc.) to be exhausted and leading it to become unresponsive. The effect is magnified when asymmetries exist allowing small messages, which are inexpensive for an attacker to generate, lead to expensive response processing on the device.Technical mechanisms to implement this mitigation can include timeout functions that will return/cancel request processing after a set amount of time after the request is made, limiting the overall bandwidth that a device will process, constraining the number of active connections a device will support, instituting request queue management and prioritization, or separating request handler code paths so that resource limits can be imposed on them. These mechanisms can work together to ensure that the network protocol handlers and services remain responsive, and that no one handler, or source of traffic, can monopolize all system processing resources.If protocol designs allow for it, expensive operations should not be performed as a result of unauthenticated or pre-authentication messages ( MID-034 - Authenticate Network Traffic) , constraining threat actors\u2019 access to easily access the most exhaustible resources.Note : Device creators should take care to ensure that the processing limits do not become the target of denial-of-service attacks themselves. For example, if a device only allows one connection at a time, threat actors may try to occupy that connection, preventing legitimate users from communicating.Limitation : Device-level mitigations cannot cope with flooding attacks that simply overwhelm the bandwidth capacity of the device\u2019s network link. In this case, upstream network devices must impose appropriate rate limits.",

Secure network tunnels are best used when devices need to support a specific insecure protocol, either for functionality or to support legacy devices, and cannot have that protocol replaced by a protocol that is more secure by default.Secure network tunnels will wrap a protocol in a more secure protocol (e.g., TLS, IPsec, SSH tunneling, etc.) that provides security features such as encryption, authentication, and message integrity checking. These added features make sending spoofed, illegitimate, or replayed messages more difficult.To enable secure network tunnels, both the sending and receiving device must be compatible with the secure tunnel protocol and the underlying wrapped protocol. If the devices themselves cannot be made compatible with the wrapping protocol, a dedicated gateway device can be placed between the incompatible device and upstream network to implement the tunnel. Therefore, the downstream device may continue to use the insecure underlying protocol, while it is shielded within the tunnel while traversing intervening networks.",

Hardware faults can be induced by various methods, including voltage fault injection (power glitching), electromagnetic pulses (EM glitching), and optical fault injection. Glitching can be used to bypass various security protections on a device, such as skipping a firmware integrity check during a secure boot process or protections against firmware or data read-out from the device. This threat requires physical access to the device to perform the glitching, and also typically requires substantial iterative testing to identify the precise nature, magnitude, and timing of signals that need to be injected to cause the glitch condition.",

Analysis of the bootloader code yielded an exploitable buffer overflow in a USB protocol implementation (see TID-327) used to inject code that bypasses secure boot and allows executing unauthorized firmware.
